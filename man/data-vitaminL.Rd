Data from the vitamin Study,
a randomized study where the growth of guinea pigs was monitored before and after intake of vitamin E/placebo.
The weight of each guinea pig was recorded at the end of week 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Vitamin E/placebo is given at the beginning of week 5.
This dataset is in the long format (i.e. one line per measurement).

\item \code{animal}: identifier
\item \code{weight1}: weight (in g) of the pig at the end of week 1 (before treatment).
\item \code{weight3}: weight (in g) of the pig at the end of week 3 (before treatment).
\item \code{weight4}: weight (in g) of the pig at the end of week 4 (before treatment).
\item \code{weight5}: weight (in g) of the pig at the end of week 5 (after treatment).
