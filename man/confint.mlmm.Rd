\description{
Compute confidence intervals for several linear mixed models.
}
\details{
Statistical inference following pooling is performed according to Rubin's rule whose validity requires the congeniality condition of Meng (1994).
 \bold{Pooling estimates}: available methods are:
\itemize{
 \item \code{"average"}: average estimates
 \item \code{"pool.fixse"}: weighted average of the estimates, with weights being the inverse of the squared standard error. The uncertainty about the weights is neglected.
 \item \code{"pool.se"}: weighted average of the estimates, with weights being the inverse of the squared standard error. The uncertainty about the weights is computed under independence of the variance parameters between models. 
 \item \code{"pool.gls"}: weighted average of the estimates, with weights being based on the variance-covariance matrix of the estimates. When this matrix is singular, its spectral decomposition is truncated when the correspodning eigenvalues are below \eqn{10^{-12}}. The uncertainty about the weights is neglected. 
 \item \code{"pool.gls1"}: similar to \code{"pool.gls"} but ensure that the weights are at most 1 in absolute value by shrinking toward the average.
 \item \code{"pool.rubin"}: average of the estimates and compute the uncertainty according to Rubin's rule (Barnard et al. 1999).
