   - CHANGE: Rename argument keep.newdata into keep.data
   - CHANGE: Argument at for partial residual calculation (instead of using an attribute on argument type).

   - REMOVE: dependency on emmeans and sandwich.

** Internal change
   - partial derivative of the residuals w.r.t. model parameters can be exported as an attribute grad.
   - standard deviation for random effect computed via delta method instead of numerical differentiation
